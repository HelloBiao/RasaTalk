<h2 align="center">Basic Overview</h2>

Rasa Talk is a Dialog Management tool built on top of Rasa NLU. It was built out of a desire for a open source on premise dialog management system. Originally inspired by Rasa UI inspiration was taken from watson conversation.

Rasa Talk can be used as just a training data generator but can also hook your chatbot up to Facebook/Skype/Slack whatever!

<p>
Due to the constumisable nature of RT it's possible to hook it up to practically any third party chatbot you'd like. For starters I've included a quick example of how you might use [Botkit](https://github.com/howdyai/botkit) as a middleware to get to Facebook

Currently Facebook has been enabled with Slack and many more still to come!
